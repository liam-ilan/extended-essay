# Computing Pi with Bouncing Cubes
This git contains my exteneded essay and software used to generate the necessary visualizations.

## Plot Graphs
To generate graphs, run

```
python main.py
```

The `opts` dictionary in main.py can be used to change the configuration of the cubes, as well as the output paths.

An animated simulation of the cube bouncing process is located in `/interactive-simulation`. It is also running at https://bouncing-cubes.snowboardsheep.repl.co/.

You can find all graphs used in the paper in `/graphs`.
